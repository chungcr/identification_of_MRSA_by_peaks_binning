*R version 3.6.3 was used for implementing the analysis.

*The packages, 'caret' (version 6.0.85), 'pROC' (version 1.16.1), 'OptimalCutpoints' (version 1.1.4), 'rpart' (version 4.1.15), 'range' (version 0.12.1), 'kknn' (version 1.3.1), 'e1071' (version 1.7.3), and 'OneR' (version 2.2), you shoud download firstly to implement these scripts directly.

*The Label in data means that result of the antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) indicated the resistant when it was label as "R"; otherwise "S".
